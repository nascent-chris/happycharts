Trading Specification:
- Primary Trading Pair: ETH/USDT
- Reference Pair (leading indicator only): BTC/USDT
- All position calculations, entries, and exits must be based on ETH/USDT pair
- BTC/USDT is to be used solely as a correlation indicator and potential signal override as defined in BTC Correlation Rules
- All prices, levels, and calculations should reference ETH/USDT unless explicitly stated as BTC analysis

Analysis Parameters:
1. Timeframe Weighting:
   - Primary analysis window (last 4 hours): 50% weight
   - Secondary window (4-24 hours): 30% weight
   - Context window (24-48 hours): 20% weight

2. Trend Definition:
   - Uptrend requires 3 consecutive higher highs AND higher lows within the primary window
   - Downtrend requires 3 consecutive lower highs AND lower lows within the primary window
   - Sideways if neither condition is met

3. Support/Resistance Levels:
   - Must have at least 3 touches with maximum 0.5% deviation
   - Must be tested in at least two different 4-hour periods
   - Valid for 24 hours after last touch

4. Significant Movement Definition (ETH/USDT):
   - Short-term: >1.5% price change within 1 hour
   - Medium-term: >3% price change within 4 hours
   - Long-term: >5% price change within 24 hours

5. BTC/USDT Correlation Rules (for ETH/USDT trading):
   - BTC/USDT movement >2% in 1 hour triggers high alert for ETH/USDT pair
   - BTC/USDT trend overrides ETH/USDT signals if:
     * BTC/USDT shows >3% movement in last 4 hours AND
     * Historical correlation >0.8 in last 24 hours
   - All position entries, exits, and adjustments must still be executed on ETH/USDT pair
   - BTC analysis should only influence timing and risk assessment, not override clear ETH/USDT technical levels
   
6. Risk Level Definitions:
   - Low Risk:
     * Price within 1% of established support/resistance
     * Volume increasing on reversal
     * Volatility (ATR) declining
     * Minimum 3 confirming signals
   - Medium Risk:
     * Price transitioning between levels
     * Normal volatility (ATR within 2 standard deviations)
     * Minimum 2 confirming signals
   - High Risk:
     * Irregular volatility (ATR outside 2 standard deviations)
     * Conflicting signals
     * Price in no-man's land (>2% from support/resistance)

7. Position Management Rules:
   For New Positions:
   - Minimum 2:1 reward-to-risk ratio required
   - Stop-loss placement:
     * For longs: Below nearest support or 2 * ATR, whichever is closer
     * For shorts: Above nearest resistance or 2 * ATR, whichever is closer
   - Take-profit targets must align with next major resistance/support level

   For Existing Positions:
   - Calculate current P&L as: ((current_price - entry_price) / entry_price * leverage * 100) for longs
   - Calculate current P&L as: ((entry_price - current_price) / entry_price * leverage * 100) for shorts
   - Consider trailing stop-loss when position is >2% profitable
   - Evaluate original trade thesis against current market conditions
   - Calculate remaining reward-to-risk ratio based on current price

Required Analysis Components:
1. Volume Analysis (ETH/USDT specific):
   - Compare current volume to 24h average
   - Note divergences between price and volume
   - Weight recent volume (4h) more heavily

2. Price Action (ETH/USDT specific):
   - Identify key candlestick patterns (requires minimum 2 candle confirmation)
   - Note any gaps or unusual candle sizes (>150% of average)
   - Track momentum using RSI (oversold <30, overbought >70)

3. Trend Analysis:
   - Primary trend (4h) for ETH/USDT
   - Secondary trend (24h) for ETH/USDT
   - Trend alignment across timeframes
   - Note any trend breaks or confirmations
   - Compare with BTC/USDT trend for confirmation only

Signal Priority Hierarchy:
1. ETH/USDT trend alignment across timeframes
2. ETH/USDT support/resistance levels with volume confirmation
3. BTC correlation impact
4. ETH/USDT candlestick patterns
5. ETH/USDT volume analysis
6. ETH/USDT momentum indicators

Position Management Requirements:
For Existing Positions:
- Hold if:
  * Original trade thesis still valid
  * No strong reversal signals
  * Current risk/reward remains favorable
  * Position showing profit or acceptable drawdown

- Close if:
  * Original trade thesis invalidated
  * Strong reversal signals present
  * Risk/reward no longer favorable
  * Stop-loss or take-profit reached
  * Position showing excessive drawdown (>50% of distance to stop-loss)

- Adjust if:
  * Position profitable and new technical levels emerge
  * Risk can be reduced without significantly impacting profit potential
  * Trailing stop-loss can lock in profits
  * Better reward/risk ratio available at new levels

For New ETH/USDT Positions:
- Long positions require:
  * Uptrend in primary timeframe
  * Price above nearest significant support
  * Minimum 2 confirming signals
  * Valid stop-loss placement within risk parameters
  
- Short positions require:
  * Downtrend in primary timeframe
  * Price below nearest significant resistance
  * Minimum 2 confirming signals
  * Valid stop-loss placement within risk parameters

Position Restriction Rules:
- No new positions if:
  * Volatility exceeds 3 standard deviations from mean
  * Spread exceeds 0.1%
  * Less than 2 confirming signals present
  * Conflicting signals in primary timeframe

All percentage calculations must align with likelihood ratings and maintain consistent internal logic. Confidence ratings should directly correlate with the number and strength of confirming signals.
